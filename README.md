Designing a Resilient Microservices Architecture for End-to-End Solutions

This title reflects the intent to start the design process with a microservices architecture from the beginning. It emphasizes the goal of creating a system, that is built on microservices principles and is designed to be resilient while providing end-to-end solutions.

I have chosen to craft a microservices architecture for this demonstration project to showcase both the benefits and challenges associated with this approach.

# how to run on local machine
1. Setup database for microservices (using Postgres)
2. Create empty database as following
* microservices_auth
* microservice_invoices
3. Configure .env files in folder (auth, invoices) and update each settings
4. In auth and invoices folders, run migrate database schema using the below command. Itâ€™s will automatically create tables that use for the demo project.
* npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
5. Start each microservices with the below command
* npm start
