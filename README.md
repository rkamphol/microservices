Designing a Resilient Microservices Architecture for End-to-End Solutions

This title reflects the intent to start the design process with a microservices architecture from the beginning. It emphasizes the goal of creating a system, that is built on microservices principles and is designed to be resilient while providing end-to-end solutions.

I have chosen to craft a microservices architecture for this demonstration project to showcase both the benefits and challenges associated with this approach.

# objectives of the Service Infrastructure Design
1. Demonstratate Modular System Resilience: Designing the system modules to operate independently so that if one service experiences downtime, other services can continue serving customers seamlessly.
Optimize Cost Efficiency with Serverless:
2. Choosing serverless architecture to maximize cost savings by leveraging on-demand resources and efficient scaling based on actual usage.
3. Scalability Management: Facilitating easy scalability of services on cloud, allowing for straightforward and efficient management of system growth and demand fluctuations.

# technology stacks
1. Frontend: React.js
Dynamic UI: React.js for responsive, component-based frontend
2. Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
Fast & Scalable: Node.js with Express.js for efficient server-side processing.
3. Authentication: JWT
Secure Access: JWT for stateless and secure user authentication.
4. Infrastructure AWS
* ECR
* ECS Fargate Serverless
* Docker
* Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless
* Application Load Balancer

# services
1. authentication
2. invoices and payments
3. client

# how to run on local machine
1. Setup database for microservices (using Postgres)
2. Create empty database as following
* microservices_auth
* microservice_invoices
3. Configure .env files in folder (auth, invoices) and update each settings
4. In auth and invoices folders, run migrate database schema using the below command. Itâ€™s will automatically create tables that use for the demo project.
* npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
5. Start each microservices with the below command
* npm start
